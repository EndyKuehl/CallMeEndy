        <h1>Who am I?</h1>
        <p>Good question. I ask myself the same thing every day. I use pronouns at such varriance, that I request you use any and all pronouns, or just use They/Them for me.</p> 
        <p>Here, you can find my many identities you'll find me in depending on the situation.</p>

        <h2>Call me Endy</h2>

        <p>You can find me online using this profile picture, it is my persona, and I made it out of clay!</p>
		<p>I will be going by the username "EndyStar", and would like if you called me that or Endy while online, as they are my online aliases.</p>
        <br>
        
        <h2>Call me Elijah</h2>

        <p>When joining an online meeting, you will find me with this profile picture or a similar variation. It is the drawing that inspired the above clay creation!</p>
		<p>This will often be tied with the name in the system, Elijah Kuehl, but just  call me Eli or Elijah. Call me this when in class.</p>
        <br>
        
        <h2>Call me Val</h2>

        <p>Whenn you see me in real life, I will often be wearing a galaxy-themed mask, so you wont see my mouth or if I have facial hair.</p>
		<p>In casual settings, call me Val, as it's the name I use when around friends, or when I'm feeling sociable!</p>
